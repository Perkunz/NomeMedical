    <h1> Ultrasound scans during pregnancy </h1>
    An ultrasound scan (sonogram) uses sound waves that bounce off solid objects to create two-dimensional black and white images on a screen.
    It's completely safe for you and your baby.
    Scans are carried out by trained healthcare professionals called sonographers
    Some midwives are also sonographers. Screening scans look for issues and check if your baby's growing well.
    Three-dimensional (3D) and colour scans aren’t routinely used by the NHS.

    <h1> When will I have an ultrasound scan? </h1>

    <p> You should be offered at least 2 scans: </p>
    <ul>
        <li> An early pregnancy scan (dating or booking scan) between 11 and 14 weeks.</li>
    </br>
        <li> A mid-pregnancy scan (also known as a fetal anomaly scan) between 18 and 21 weeks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1> What your ultrasound scan can show </h1>
<p> Your scan can show: </p>
    <ul>
        <li> your baby’s size, which is important for finding out when they’re due to arrive. </li>
    </br>
        <li> the way your baby's lying in your womb, which is important when you give birth. </li>
    </br>
        <li> whether you’re having one or more babies. </li>
    </br>
        <li> how your baby’s organs and bones are developing, including their spinal cord, kidneys, bowel, brain, heart, arms, and legs. </li>
